# Information-System-of-HDFC
The presentation on the Information System of HDFC Ltd. explores its organizational structure, core banking solutions, and the role of information systems at different management levels. Established in 1977, HDFC Ltd. merged with HDFC Bank on July 1, 2023, offering a wide range of financial services. Its Core Banking System supports both corporate and retail banking, providing scalable, web-enabled solutions for efficient financial transactions. The company utilizes Finware and Flexcube as its primary banking solutions. At the top management level, strategic data such as market trends and financial reports are processed for planning, forecasting, and decision-making, generating strategic reports and dashboards. Middle management relies on operational data for budgeting, resource allocation, and performance analysis, producing budget reports and departmental performance summaries. At the lower level, transactional and daily operational data are used for transaction processing, data entry, and record-keeping, resulting in transaction logs and operational reports. The presentation highlights how HDFC Ltd. effectively integrates information systems to enhance decision-making, improve efficiency, and optimize customer service.
